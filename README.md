## 🚀 About Me

Hi, I'm Heiko. My early passion for programming was sparked by building browser games (PHP/MySQL).
I later taught myself VBA to optimize processes on my own. Building on that foundation,
I am now diving into the world of mobile app development, working with SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose.

My ambition is to develop apps that are not only technically sound but also provide an intuitive
and delightful user experience. Always with clean code, an eye for detail, and a touch of humor.
